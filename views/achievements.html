        <ul>
            <li>Built, iterated and delivered a service in 7 days that enabled over 10,000 people to apply for a
                business rate grant during the covid pandemic.</li>
            <li>Delivered a webinar on â€œGetting up and running with AWS SAM'' drawing from my recent learning about
                serverless on the AWS platform that enabled me to create a database and REST endpoint using
                Cloudformation templates, lambda and API gateway.</li>
            <li>Contributed to the development and implementation of our CI/CD pipeline which required me to work with
                new technologies and languages including; Python, Selenium, Azure DevOps pipelines and YAML. Automating
                these processes enabled us to reduce time and costs spent manually completing these tasks, as well as,
                improving the confidence and stability in our releases.</li>
